# ML_Example
A machine learning example in python.  This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and dataset (the Iris dataset from UCI).

You need to install anaconda on either OSX or Linux.  Running Ubutu on the Windows 10 subsystem works just as well.

From a bash terminal create the environment you will need to execute the notebook:

    conda env create --name py3 -f=envrinment.yml
